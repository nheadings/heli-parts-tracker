# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Legacy iOS App

**This folder contains the original iOS app prototype and is no longer maintained.**

**Current active app is in:** `/ios-appnew/HeliPartsTracker/`

## Why Deprecated

This was an initial proof-of-concept. The active development has moved to `ios-appnew` which includes:
- Complete logbook system with editable entries
- Fluid tracking and life-limited parts
- Maintenance schedules
- Comprehensive dashboard
- Better code organization

## Migration

If you need to reference this code, all functionality has been migrated and improved in the new app location.

Please use the current README at: `/ios-appnew/HeliPartsTracker/README.md`
